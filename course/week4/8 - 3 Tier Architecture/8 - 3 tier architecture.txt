Controllers, Services, Models (POJOs), Mappers (DAOs)

Become comfortable with the general architecture of a Maven based RESTful API (and many other applications).
This general package architecture is:
#* src main
#** -> java
#*** -> app root name
#**** controllers
#**** mappers
#**** models
#**** services

#* What kind of classes do we put in each package?
