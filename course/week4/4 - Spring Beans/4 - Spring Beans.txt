@Bean, @Service, @Component @Repository, @Controller


We can wire, aka configure, Spring beans in two ways. The older, more difficult way is by using XML configurations.
The newer, nicer way is by using annotations.
In the comments below, please demonstrate the creation of Spring bean using both annotations and XML configuration.


What is a Spring Bean?


Spring beans can be wired using either XML or annotations.
XML is preferred by many as it keeps all your bean definitions in one place.
While others don't like XML definitions as they're tedious compared to annotations such as @Bean, @Configuration, and @Service.
