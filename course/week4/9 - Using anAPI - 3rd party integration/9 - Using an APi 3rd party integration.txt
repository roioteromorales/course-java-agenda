Integrate with third party APIs in two ways:
using Springs RestTemplate (https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/)
using HttpClient (https://alvinalexander.com/java/java-apache-httpclient-restful-client-examples)
Be sure you can fully map the response of both to Java objects in your program. Link to both examples below.
