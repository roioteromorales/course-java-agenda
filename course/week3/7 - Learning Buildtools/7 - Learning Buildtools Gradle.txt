Gradle
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recommended way to execute any Gradle build is with the help of the Gradle Wrapper (in short just “Wrapper”).
The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.
As a result, developers can get up and running with a Gradle project quickly without having to follow manual installation processes saving your company time and money.

Where does that folder live?
Navigate that folder to understand how Maven manages those dependencies.
