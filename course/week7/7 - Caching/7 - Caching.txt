EhCache, Gemfire, Spring Cache - @cacheable, @cacheput...

EhCache
Add an EhCache implementation to one of your projects.
Refer to our example from class: https://github.com/rdesmond/spring-ehcache-example

GEMFIRE
Start with this tutorial:
https://spring.io/guides/gs/caching-gemfire/
Then take some time to implement caching with GemFire in one of your applications at a larger scale.
Then, take a bit of time to explore the Gemfire documentation to get a better understanding of how much you can do with it,
and how much it can scale (run in a distributed manner) to a massive organization.
