CRON
It is very often necessary to schedule tasks, calls, etc to be run on your application.
For instance, to have a background task that calls your API every 5 minutes to go gather the last 5 minutes of data from some API and persist it to the DB.
There are many schedulers out there that can be used, but the most common and simple option is called a cron job.
It's actually quite simple.

Deploy one of your APIs to EC2 and setup a cron job to call one your endpoints on a regular basis.
