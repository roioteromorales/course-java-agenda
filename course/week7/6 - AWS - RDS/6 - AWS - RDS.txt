Deploying DBs to RDS
If someone asked you,
What is AWS RDS?
Why is it worth using?
How would you respond?
Please explain in as much detail as possible.

What ports must we open, via our AWS Security Groups, on an RDS instance so that we can properly connect to the DB?

What do we need to do in our application so that our applications are communicating with a remote RDS instance rather than a local database?
